I’ve replaced all the drives with mostly SSDs and a single large HDD and maxed out the RAM to 32GB. My primary os is Manjaro on top of Arch, usually with Gnome for the desktop. I love this computer because it is perfect for my needs. It will probably still be usable and pretty functional off the network in 5 years. It even has an RS-232 port, originally for printers, but also extremely useful for vintage and complex hardware nerds and people with plotters, like me. It can do virtualization, run Windows if necessary, and after I switched to mostly SSDs, runs quiet and fast enough. Since I mostly develop for system environments and servers, I don’t worry much about software since this guy doesn’t typically need to interface with any non-OSS stuff. It works well as a host for Android devices and small electronics.

I use a 2017 Dell XPS developer edition laptop running Fedora + LXQT with an extremely well-tuned terminal emulator and Neovim/Tmux setup because most of my work on the laptop is at the command line. This is probably the best Linux laptop I’ve ever encountered and am going to try to hold onto it for as long as it keeps going. Unfortunately the RAM is soldered into the mobo on these bad lads (terrible design decision, stop that!) and can’t be upgraded; one stick has already died in mine, so I’m living on the edge. In case you’re wondering what makes a great laptop for this kind of work, it is onboard ethernet jack and SD card reader with a normal power supply input that is a standard shape used in other electronics (easy to replace the power charger if lost). Also it is very light. Also it is that in-between generation with USB-A 3.0 AND USB-C jacks. Supremely useful layout. I don’t use this laptop for software tools or IDE’s. It is really just for network troubleshooting and implementation and working with text files.

I need some big SSD because two HDD running in it is loud as hell. I can walk around with it to connect it to another computer or the network hub depending on what I am doing. I also carry an SSD drive around with me to sites and plotters etc in one of those sata-to-usb hard cases. Way more useful than SD cards because it is harder to lose and doesn’t require an additional card reader.

I need to upgrade the drives to SSD but the HPE is a fancy lad and requires fancy drives that I am not ready to splash out for. I’ve had no problems with it but I think I will eventually unless I get the iLo dongle since I eventually plan to move it to a colo facility and without the dongle I’m not sure I’ll be able to upgrade Proxmox itself without the iLo piece. Proxmox VE is great and I cannot recommend it enough if you have the hardware for a separate virtualization instance.

I use a 2020 Dell XPS with a lot of horsepower and the WSL. I don’t do much if any development work on the Windows machine because I love my local machine so much but I can manage with using IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code connecting to a virtual machine on the hypervisor. Otherwise it is primarily used for running software like Solidworks and Affinity, using the plotter, and writing/testing documentation that requires testing against Windows. I don’t really use the WSL interface much except for simple reproductions (it is running on Docker). I don’t really know much powershell though so it can be useful for a functional command line interface on Windows. Periodically I am forced to use the Windows machine for debugging some weird hardware/device problem that Linux is having problems opening a connection to.

I use mine to print plans and patterns of materials to be cut. Plotters are extremely cool and useful if you are working with big things and materials that need to have precise placement, because they can accept CAD and flat vector files with edges and paths. They’re what you need if you want to cut vinyl to a specific font and size to apply at an exact angle around a corner, for example, because they can be calibrated for more specific clearances than a paper printer. They can also accept a variety of substrates. I mostly use paper and the pen and cut my pattern pieces by hand.

The Intuos has good ability to map the physical buttons to application hotkeys but I only really use it for zooming and panning in the document.

When I decided to make a personal site, I first had to work through months of internal resistance to the actual content generation; What the hell am I going to write about?! was all that came to mind when I tried to begin. There are probably enough tutorials on the internet already, I would tell myself. I definitely do not wish to increase my ’engagement’ with a potential ‘audience’, I’d fret. Isn’t that what a ‘blog’ is for? After much soul searching I decided to treat this site as my public project notebook and commonplace book. This site is for two things: tracking and logging the ongoing and often boring work I do on a regular basis for reference later writeups on projects I complete and want to share with others What that means is this site is mostly for my use and of interest only to myself. I don’t intend to create much in the way of “technical blog content”; instead I am mostly logging and tracking my ongoing work and progression across various projects. These logs are intended mostly for me and my later reference.

I have proficiency in all three areas and it is very easy for me to go off on a tangent for weeks at a time and then need to return to work that has been sitting for weeks or months. This is normal in all three domains, and it’s not a problem in itself. Often I need to wait for input from others I am collaborating with and while I am waiting on one thing I switch to another. The problem arises when I need to resume a previously-started thread. Until now I’ve been rather disorganized or solo with my logging and tracking on the streams, mostly because until this point I’ve mostly worked solo with the design and still learning on the manufacturing stuff. I’m reaching a point where I want to both improve the speed of my output as well as refine and improve the quality of my collaborative work.

Design is different from development is different from manufacturing, but the way I use them all have a lot of common elements (computers, documentation, messes that need to be cleaned up, project managers, deadlines). My goal with introducing this site to my workflow is to create a better living logging and tracking documentation for the daily tasks. While I expect this to initially increase the amount of time I spend on daily admin, long term I expect it to pay dividends in terms of being able to easily reference, cross-reference, link, metric and otherwise treat my personal work logs with the same interactivity and toolset as my software.

I log everything already in my personal work planning but there isn’t any real accountability or tracking ability or other tooling possible with my ever-expanding text file of personal commentary.

I’m a software developer and industrial designer in training. I’m also the founder of Documentation Services and an alumni of several notable tech companies. I mostly work with backend systems and peripheral hardware, and I like Kotlin and Rust. I am also learning how to design, prototype and manufacture the case and physical enclosures for devices. You may find an overview of the tools I use in my work here and a short explainer on why I made this site and what I use it for here. Occasionally I receive requests regarding freelance industrial design work or if I am willing to sell any of my projects. For now I’m not positioned to do that sort of work and the projects are not for sale, but I am exploring how to do both in the future. I do share the design files and code for most of the devices I share here, though; if you run into a consistent issue during printing using my files without changes and would like to let me know, please feel free to reach out to me at hi@leemaret.com or open a PR against the project repository.
