I am not a natural blogger. When I decided to make a personal site, I first had to work through months of internal resistance to the actual content generation; _What the hell am I going to write about?!_ was all that came to mind when I tried to begin. There are probably enough tutorials on the internet already, I would tell myself. I definitely do not wish to increase my 'engagement' with a potential 'audience', I'd fret. Isn't that what a 'blog' is for?

After much soul searching I decided to treat this site as my public project notebook and [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book). This site is for two things:
<br>
- tracking and logging the ongoing and often boring work I do on a regular basis for reference later
- writeups on projects I complete and want to share with others
<br>

What that means is this site is mostly for my use and of interest only to myself. I don't intend to create much in the way of "technical blog content"; instead I am mostly logging and tracking my ongoing work and progression across various projects. These logs are intended mostly for me and my later reference.

## the problem

I work at the intersection of a few different domains: software, manufacturing, and design. I have proficiency in all three areas and it is very easy for me to go off on a tangent for weeks at a time and then need to return to work that has been sitting for weeks or months. This is normal in all three domains, and it's not a problem in itself. Often I need to wait for input from others I am collaborating with and while I am waiting on one thing I switch to another.

The problem arises when I need to resume a previously-started thread. Until now I've been rather disorganized or solo with my logging and tracking on the streams, mostly because until this point I've mostly worked solo with the design and still learning on the manufacturing stuff. I'm reaching a point where I want to both improve the speed of my output as well as refine and improve the quality of my collaborative work. 

### improving speed

This is less about actual speed of accomplishment but ease and speed in context switching between one of the streams. Design is different from development is different from manufacturing, but the way I use them all have a lot of common elements (computers, documentation, messes that need to be cleaned up, project managers, deadlines). My goal with introducing this site to my workflow is to create a better living logging and tracking documentation for the daily tasks. While I expect this to initially increase the amount of time I spend on daily admin, long term I expect it to pay dividends in terms of being able to easily reference, cross-reference, link, metric and otherwise treat my personal work logs with the same interactivity and toolset as my software.

### refine collaborative work

I've worked in software production for many years but I started in the network and operational space, not development. Netops is a bit less focused on collaboration than software or product work, and while I'm comfortable with a standard PR workflow, I'd like to improve my skills with a big collaborative project with many people. I hope to use both the regular work tracking and project writeups as a means to improve and refine my collaborative work to larger open source and other projects.

## the site solution

### regular tracking

Not every day is the fun kind of productive. Sometimes it really is just cleaning and tech debt or updating docs. But I don't log that stuff, or a lot of my good ideas during my busy peaks when I am in the zone on something fun or requiring a lot of messy cleanup. 

I log everything already in my personal work planning but there isn't any real accountability or tracking ability or other tooling possible with my ever-expanding text file of personal commentary. Writing here (and integrating with CI tooling and some other site functionality) introduces possibilities like graphing contribution activity over time and where, assessing project interest from others, and a better understanding of where I am spending my time. 

For the time being, these are published under the site section [Posts](/posts) and organized by date. 

### project write ups

Currently I don't have a nice means of sharing my projects with others aside from direct email or some type of social media sharing. I'm not really "into" social media, so a personal site for sharing makes more sense for me. 

For the time being, these are posted under the site section [Projects](/projects) and posts are organized by project, not date.
