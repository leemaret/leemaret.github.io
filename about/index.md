# About

<br>

Hi, I'm Lee. I'm a software developer and industrial designer in training. I'm also the founder of [Documentation Services](#!) and an alumni of several notable tech companies. I mostly work with backend systems and peripheral hardware, and I like Kotlin and Rust. I am also learning how to design, prototype and manufacture the case and physical enclosures for devices. 

<br>

You may find an overview of the tools I use in my work [here](/lab-overview) and a short explainer on why I made this site and what I use it for [here](/about-this-site).

<br>

Occasionally I receive requests regarding freelance industrial design work or if I am willing to sell any of my projects. For now  I'm not positioned to do that sort of work and the projects are not for sale, but I am exploring how to do both in the future. I do share the design files and code for most of the devices I share here, though; if you run into a consistent issue during printing using my files without changes and would like to let me know, please feel free to reach out to me at hi@leemaret.com or open a PR against the project repository. If the files are public, they're open source and clearly marked as such, and you do not require my permission or clearance to use them in your own projects.
